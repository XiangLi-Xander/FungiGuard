# FungiGuard
FungiGuard is an innovative project aimed at developing an artificial intelligence solution for the classification of plant antifungal peptides (AFPs). Leveraging machine learning techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and attention mechanisms.

## Protein Sequence Classification

This project involves classifying protein sequences using multiple machine learning models. The sequence classification is performed using a pre-trained Random Forest model. The sequences are provided in a `.fa` (FASTA) file format.

## Features

- Reads protein sequences from a `.fa` file.
- Processes sequences to ensure they are of the correct length and format.
- Classifies sequences using five different pre-trained models.
- Outputs classification results to an Excel file.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed below)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
